Feature: user request for password

@login
@resetPasswordRequest
Scenario: user enter his email and ask for new password
	Given user with email "webmaster@l4m.fr" has no active password request
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"   
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/request/password" with body:
    """
    {
        "email": "webmaster@l4m.fr"
    }
    """
  	Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And email with subject "RÃ©initialisation de votre mot de passe pour les salons emploi L4M" should have been sent to "webmaster@l4m.fr"
